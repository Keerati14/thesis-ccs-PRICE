##PRICE — Policy Revenue for Industrial CCS Enablement (Thesis Code)

Code, notebooks, and minimal data to reproduce the core figures and results of my MSc Environmental Technology thesis at Imperial College London.

The PRICE workflow screens policy price levels (a baseline carbon tax plus an ETS coverage-proxy) that make industrial CCS projects feasible in ASEAN heavy-industry sectors. Outputs include feasibility frontiers, robustness heatmaps, and policy payment stacks, expressed in constant 2024 USD/tCO₂.
